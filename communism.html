            <h2>About Communism</h2>
            <p>Communism is a philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose goal is the establishment of a communist society, namely a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common or social ownership of all property and the absence of social classes, money, and the state.</p>
            <p>The ideology seeks to overcome the class struggle by creating a society in which the means of production are commonly owned and controlled by the community as a whole, rather than by private individuals or corporations.</p>
            <p>Key principles of communist theory include:</p>
            <p>• Class Struggle: The idea that history is shaped by conflicts between classes, primarily the proletariat (working class) and the bourgeoisie (capitalist class). The aim is to abolish class distinctions.<br>
            • Collective Ownership: The means of production (factories, land, resources) should be owned collectively or by the state to prevent exploitation by private owners.<br>
            • Abolition of Private Property: Private ownership of the means of production is seen as a source of inequality and should be replaced with communal ownership.<br>
            • Centralized Planning: Economic decisions should be made collectively or by the state to ensure equitable distribution of resources and eliminate market inefficiencies.<br>
            • Distribution Based on Need: Resources and goods should be distributed according to individual needs rather than through market mechanisms or ability to pay.<br>
            • Internationalism: Solidarity among the working class globally, transcending national borders, to achieve a worldwide communist system.</p>
